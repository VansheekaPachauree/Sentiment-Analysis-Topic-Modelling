# Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modelling
End-to-end sentiment analysis and topic modelling pipeline on twitter data, combining transformer-based relabelling with classical ML and LDA to reduce noise and extract actionable insights.

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end text analytics pipeline on tweets. It addresses noisy distant-supervision labels using transformer-based relabelling, followed by topic modelling to extract interpretable insights.

## Pipeline
- Text preprocessing and cleaning  
- Transformer-based relabelling 
- Topic modelling using LDA  

## Tools
Python, scikit-learn, transformers, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud, collections, re, string, nltk

## Outcomes
Improved label quality, clearer topic separation, and interpretable sentiment-driven themes.
